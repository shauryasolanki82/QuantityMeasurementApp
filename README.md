## 🔵 Phase 1 — Length Measurement *(UC1–UC7)*  

| UC | Branch | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| UC1 | [`feature/UC1-FeetEquality`](./tree/feature/UC1-FeetEquality) | Validate equality between two feet values |
| UC2 | [`feature/UC2-InchesEquality`](./tree/feature/UC2-InchesEquality) | Validate equality between two inch values |
| UC3 | [`feature/UC3-GenericLength`](./tree/feature/UC3-GenericLength) | Introduced `LengthUnit` enum with conversion logic |
| UC4 | [`feature/UC4-YardEquality`](./tree/feature/UC4-YardEquality) | Added `YARDS` unit (1 yard = 3 feet = 36 inches) |
| UC5 | [`feature/UC5-UnitToUnitConversion`](./tree/feature/UC5-UnitToUnitConversion) | Enabled unit-to-unit conversion |
| UC6 | [`feature/UC6-UnitAddition`](./tree/feature/UC6-UnitAddition) | Added support for adding different units |
| UC7 | [`feature/UC7-TargetUnitAddition`](./tree/feature/UC7-TargetUnitAddition) | Result returned in first operand’s unit |
